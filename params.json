Panda3D is open-source and free for any purpose,\r\nincluding commercial ventures, thanks to its\r\n[liberal license](https://www.panda3d.org/license.php).  To learn more about\r\nPanda3D's capabilities, visit the [gallery](https://www.panda3d.org/gallery.php)\r\nand the [feature list](https://www.panda3d.org/features.php).  To learn how to\r\nuse Panda3D, check the [documentation](https://www.panda3d.org/documentation.php)\r\nresources. If you get stuck, ask for help from our active\r\n[community](https://www.panda3d.org/community.php).\r\n\r\nPanda3D is licensed under the Modified BSD License.  See the LICENSE file for\r\nmore details.\r\n\r\nBuilding Panda3D\r\n================\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n-------\r\n\r\nWe currently build using the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 compiler.  You do not\r\nneed Microsoft Visual Studio to build Panda3D, though - the relevant compilers\r\nare included as part of the Windows 7.1 SDK.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to have the third-party dependency libraries available for\r\nthe build scripts to use.  These are available from here:\r\nhttps://www.panda3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=16346\r\n\r\nAfter acquiring these dependencies, you may simply build Panda3D from the\r\ncommand prompt using the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmakepanda\\makepanda.bat --everything --installer\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the build succeeds, it will produce an .exe file that you can use to\r\ninstall Panda3D on your system.\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBuilding Panda3D on Linux is easy.  All you need is to invoke the makepanda\r\nscript using the version of Python that you want Panda3D to be built against.\r\n\r\nRun makepanda.py with the --help option to see which options are available.\r\nUsually, you will want to specify the --everything option (which builds with\r\nsupport for all features for which it detects the prerequisite dependencies)\r\nand the --installer option (which produces an installable .deb or .rpm file\r\nfor you to install, depending on your distribution).\r\n\r\nThe following command illustrates how to build Panda3D with some common\r\noptions:\r\n```bash\r\npython2.7 makepanda/makepanda.py --everything --installer --no-egl --no-gles --no-gles2\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will probably see some warnings saying that it's unable to find several\r\ndependency packages.  You should determine which ones you want to include in\r\nyour build and install the respective development packages.  You may visit\r\n[this manual page](https://www.panda3d.org/manual/index.php/Dependencies)\r\nfor an overview of the various dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you are on Ubuntu, this command should cover the most frequently\r\nused third-party packages:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get install python-dev libpng-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxrandr-dev libxxf86dga-dev libxcursor-dev bison flex libfreetype6-dev libvorbis-dev libjpeg-dev libeigen3-dev libopenal-dev libode-dev libbullet-dev nvidia-cg-toolkit\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce Panda3D has built, you can either install the .deb or .rpm package that\r\nit produced (if relevant to your platform, and you added --installer).  On\r\nother systems, you will need to use the installpanda script to install it onto\r\nyour system.  Careful: it is not easy to uninstall Panda3D in this way!\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython2.7 makepanda/installpanda.py --prefix=/usr/local\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
